Data set online research:

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems".
Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, the data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.

The set consists of measurements, in centimetres, of 50 samples of each of three types of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor and virginica) – 150 in total. 
For each of the type the following measurements were taken – sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, that is four measurements in total.
